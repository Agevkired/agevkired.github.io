Current hosting Cow Puzzle

Eat grass
Shoot wolves

Earn points by having same color grass adjacent when eating. More grass eaten also gives more turns.
Wolves will slowly move towards the cow. This is indicated by the wolf track on the right.
If a wolf touches a cow, the cow gets eaten. Lots of turns are lost, but it is not a game over.
Game over when out of turns.

Wolf track on the side only moves when cow actions are done: eating, moving.

Controls:
WASD - move cow
Arrow - shift grass row/column
Space - eat grass
F - shoot nearest wolf
